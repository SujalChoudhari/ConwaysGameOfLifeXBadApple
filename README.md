**Bad Apple in Conway's Game of Life**

**Overview**

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a famous cellular automaton, with a twist: it incorporates "Bad Apple" to influence the game's evolution. The game is simulated using the Pygame library, and the video is processed using OpenCV.

**How it works**

1. The program initializes a grid of binary values, representing the game's initial state.
2. The "Bad Apple" video is played and processed frame by frame.
3. For each frame, the program simulates the game's evolution using the Game of Life rules.
4. The game's state is updated based on the current frame's brightness.
5. The game's state is then rendered on a Pygame screen.
6. The rendered game is saved as a video file.

**Features**

* Simulates Conway's Game of Life with video influence
* Supports various video file formats
* Saves the game's evolution as a video file
* Uses OpenCV for video processing and Pygame for rendering

**Usage**

1. Run the program with the correct source video file.
2. See the live preview and save the game's evolution as a video file.

**Note**

* The program assumes that the "Bad Apple" video file is in a format supported by OpenCV.
* The program uses a simple thresholding method to convert pixel brightness to a binary value. This may not work well for all videos.
* The program's performance may degrade for large video files or complex game states.

**Acknowledgments**

* This project is inspired by the original Conway's Game of Life and its many implementations.
* The video influence feature is a novel addition, inspired by the concept of "bad apple" in the Game of Life.

**Code**

The code for this project is available in the `main.py` file.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* Pygame
* OpenCV
* A video of "Bad Apple"
